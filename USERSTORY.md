About me  

I qualified as an Osteopath in 2017 from the International College of Osteopathic Medicine. Prior to this I completed a foundation degree in Sports Therapy and a ITEC level 3 qualification in Sports massage.  

As a result of this, my style of Osteopathic treatment incorporates the best bits of Sports massage and Osteopathy which work well together and have good results for a lot of my patients.  

In my spare time, I like catching up with friends and family, and walking a long the sea front.  

 

 

Why you might need me?  

So when would you need an Osteopath?

Back pain, upper, middle and lower 

Neck pain 

Joint pain (shoulders, knees, wrists, elbows, hips, knees, ankles etc) 

Osteoarthritis symptoms 

Headaches (that are brought on by tension)

What is Osteopathy 

Osteopathy has been available in the UK for over 100 years. It is a well recognised discipline accepted by the medical profession and now available to some on the NHS. Osteopathy is the manual therapy which aims to help the body return to a state of optimal health. Patients primarily consult an osteopath with their body expressing the memory of a previous trauma, be it physical, psychological or a combination of the two. Osteopaths have time to listen to their patients and consider problems that may seem unrelated and yet are crucial to that patient’s well-being. 

Central to the osteopathic concept is that if the structure of the body has been impaired then it is unable to function efficiently. The osteopath will assess the structure of the body by examining areas such as posture and mobility, and will use appropriate techniques in order to improve the function. 

This form of assessment is the great strength of the osteopathic profession, as it takes into account all aspects of a patient’s lifestyle in order to treat the cause of the condition, not just the symptoms of it. 

Osteopathic treatment is aimed at improving the mechanics of the body which automatically influences areas such as blood and nerve supply as well as activity of the internal organs. It is because of this that osteopathy, as well as treating the more obvious headaches, joint problems, sports injuries and postural strains, can also be used in the treatment of less obvious conditions such as asthma, digestive disorders, menstrual problems and chronic fatigue syndrome. 

After the treatment course, responsibility is ultimately returned to the patient in terms of exercise and lifestyle advice so that they might maintain this recovered state of optimal health, with the osteopath remaining a source of ongoing support and direction as required.

What is Osteopathy?

Explanation of Osteopathy:
Osteopathy has been available in the UK for over 100 years and is a well-recognised discipline accepted by the medical profession, with some services available on the NHS.
It is a manual therapy aimed at helping the body return to a state of optimal health.
Patients primarily consult an Osteopath with bodily issues related to previous trauma, whether physical, psychological, or both.
Central to the osteopathic concept is the idea that if the structure of the body is impaired, it cannot function efficiently.
Osteopaths assess body structure by examining posture and mobility, employing techniques to improve function.
Treatment Approach

Assessment and Treatment Philosophy:
The osteopathic approach considers all aspects of a patient’s lifestyle to treat the cause of the condition, not just the symptoms.
Osteopathic treatment aims to improve the mechanics of the body, influencing blood and nerve supply as well as the activity of internal organs.
Conditions that can benefit from osteopathy include not just headaches and joint problems, but also asthma, digestive disorders, menstrual issues, and chronic fatigue syndrome.
After treatment, the responsibility returns to the patient for exercise and lifestyle advice, with the Osteopath providing ongoing support and guidance as needed.
